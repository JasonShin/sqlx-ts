SQLx-ts is a CLI application featuring compile-time checked queries without a DSL and prevents broken SQL queries being run during runtime.

- **Compile time checked queries** - never ship a broken SQL query to production

### Inspiration

I've been writing Rust for a while, mostly for side projects. I'm always interested in bringing benefits of Rust's amazing ecosystem and philosophy back into languages that many of us use daily such as Typescript and Python. Rust's philosophy of keeping your core logic completely type-safe has inspired me

### ROADMAP

##### Phase 1

- [x] swc to parse JavaScript/TypeScript
- [x] pick all sql`` tagged template literals
- [x] compilation success if no errors detected in SQLs
- [x] compilation failure if any error is detected in SQLs

##### Phase 2

- [ ] CLI integration - supporting parameters for folder source, database credentials and etc
- [ ] Add more complex Typescript and Javascript examples in `samples` folder

##### Phase 3

- [ ] Support for MySQL, SQLite and possibly mssql
- [ ] Run sqlx-tx-core multi-threaded and check multiple files at once
  - [ ] at this point we should try bench-marking performance difference
- [ ] Support for multiple database connections to difference DBs at once

##### Phase 4

- [ ] Publish an NPM module with `sql` tagged template literal. It shouldn't do anything special but return the raw SQL back again
