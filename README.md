Built to free Node developers from ORMs' unpredictably generated SQL queries

<br />

SQLx-ts is a CLI application featuring compile-time checked queries without a DSL and prevents broken SQL queries being run during runtime.

- **Compile time checked queries** - never ship a broken SQL query to production

### ROADMAP

##### Phase 1

- [x] swc to parse JavaScript/TypeScript
- [x] pick all sql`` tagged template literals
- [x] compilation success if no errors detected in SQLs
- [x] compilation failure if any error is detected in SQLs

##### Phase 2

- [ ] CLI integration - supporting parameters for folder source, database credentials and etc
- [ ] Add more complex Typescript and Javascript examples in `samples` folder

##### Phase 3

- [ ] Support for MySQL, SQLite and possibly mssql
- [ ] Run sqlx-tx-core multi-threaded and check multiple files at once
  - [ ] at this point we should try bench-marking performance difference
- [ ] Support for multiple database connections to difference DBs at once

##### Phase 4

- [ ] Publish an NPM module with `sql` tagged template literal. It shouldn't do anything special but return the raw SQL back again

### Motivation

Rust's philosophy of guaranteed compile-time safety of your code has always inspired me. Rust is still new and many seasoned developers would view Rust's increased benefit/cost ratio claims are as yet unproven. However, there are lessons from these new technologies that we can bring back to our everyday languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript. [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) is a great example of this, although the idea isn't directly co-related to Rust, but its philosophy well-aligns with Rust's overall ecosystem.
