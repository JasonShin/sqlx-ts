SQLx-ts is a CLI application featuring compile-time checked queries without a DSL and prevents broken SQL queries being run during runtime.

- **Compile time checked queries** - never ship a broken SQL query to production
- **TypeScript type generations** - generates type definitions based on the raw SQLs and you can use them with any MySQL or PostgreSQL driver
- **Database Agnostic** - support for [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- **TypeScript and JavaScript** - supports for both [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and JavaScript

### Installation

##### Install sqlx-ts npm module

If you are using npm
```bash
$ npm install sqlx-ts
```

If you are using yarn
```bash
$ yarn add sqlx-ts
```

And to use sqlx-ts in your code

In TypeScript based projects:

```typescript
import { sql } from 'sqlx-ts'

// ...
const query = sql`SELECT * FROM some_table;`
// ...
```


In Babel based projects:

```javascript
import { sql } from 'sqlx-ts'
const query = sql`SELECT * FROM some_table;`

// ... or

const { sql } = require('sqlx-ts')
const query = sql`SELECT * FROM some_table;`
```

##### Installing binary

###### Using cargo

To install sqlx-ts using cargo

### Motivation

Rust's philosophy of guaranteed compile-time safety of your code has always inspired me. Rust is still new and many seasoned developers would view Rust's increased benefit/cost ratio claims are as yet unproven. However, there are lessons from these new technologies that we can bring back to our everyday languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript. [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) is a great example of this, although the idea isn't directly co-related to Rust, but its philosophy well-aligns with Rust's overall ecosystem.
