# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Safety is one of the core principle of sqlx-ts, and to that end, we would like to ensure that Rust has a secure implementation. 
Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose any issues you find.

All security bugs in the CLI and node module distributions should be reported by email to visualbbasic@gmail.com or create a GitHub issue.
Your vulnerability report will be acknowledged as soon as possible, and youâ€™ll receive a more detailed response to your enquiry indicating the next steps in handling your report.

While sqlx-ts is sitting on the safe side as it's a CLI application, we still would like to be alerted on any security issues and react on those issues ASAP.
