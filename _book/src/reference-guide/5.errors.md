| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| E001       | `Unable to infer an appropriate name for the query` When you have a query in the code but SQLx-ts is unable to correctly infer a name of the query, refer <add a link to the page> for more details                                                                                          |
| E002       | `Failed to fetch query name from annotation` This error occurs if the query name from the annotation is malformed. @name should be formatted `@name: query name`                                                                                                                             |
| E003       | `Missing alias when handling functions` If you are using a SQL function and expect sqlx-ts to generate the type definition for it, you must provide an alias. For example `SELECT COUNT(*) AS the_count`                                                                                     |
| E004       | `Invalid TypeScript file path`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| E005       | `Failed to handle a wildcard statement without target table in FROM statement` For some reason, you have a wildcard selection query `SELECT * FROM X` but the sqlx-ts is unable to pick up the target table. Please double check the SQL query and make sure the target table `FROM` exists. |
| E006       | `Failed to handle a wildcard statement as it reached a dead-end expression` You would never hit this error - it would only happen if your wildcard query is not actually a SELECT statement                                                                                                  |
| E007       | `Unsupported table with joins statement detected` You would never reach this unless the query has a malformed FROM statement in your SELECT * query                                                                                                                                          |
| E008       | `The query contains unknown placeholder parameter symbol` MySQL expects `?` and PostgreSQL expects `$n` for query parameter symbols                                                                                                                                                          |
| E009       | `When translating a function in a SELECT clause, you must provide an alias`. functions used as part of SELECT must come with an alias                                                                                                                                                        |
| E010       | `Unknown function detected while processing a SELECT clause` You are using a SQL function that sqlx-ts does not know                                                                                                                                                                         |
| E011       | `table name was not found while processing an identifier` FROM is not found in the query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
