SQLx-ts is a CLI application featuring compile-time checked queries without a DSL and prevents broken SQL queries being run during runtime.

- **Compile time checked queries** - never ship a broken SQL query to production
- **TypeScript type generations** - generates type definitions based on the raw SQLs and you can use them with any MySQL or PostgreSQL driver
- **Database Agnostic** - support for [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- **TypeScript and JavaScript** - supports for both [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and JavaScript
