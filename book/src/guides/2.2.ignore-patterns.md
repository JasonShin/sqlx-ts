# .sqlxignore

you can use `.sqlxignore` file in order to ignore certain files from being processed.

By default, `*.queries.ts` are ignored by sqlx-ts as these files are the default extension of generated types.

You can include more files in the ignore list by creating `.sqlxignore`

```
*.queries.ts
*.something.*
```

`*` ignores all matching patterns.
- The first one ignores all files with `.queries.ts` extension
- The second one ignores all files that has `.something.` as part of the file path / name
