# SQL Check

Checking SQL is the core functionality of sqlx-ts. It is the default command when you run 
`sqlx-ts` binary as well.

By default, you pass in connection options to connect to the primary database. You can configure how 
sqlx-ts figures out database connection configurations by checking out the [configuration page](../guides/2.configuration.md)

To find out more about running SQL checks against different databases:

- [MySQL](./1.1.sql-check-mysql.md)
- [Postgres](./1.2.sql-check-postgres.md)
