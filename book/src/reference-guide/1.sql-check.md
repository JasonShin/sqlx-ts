# SQL Check

Checking SQL is the core functionality of sqlx-ts. It is the default command when you run 
`sqlx-ts` binary as well.

By default, you pass in connection options to connect to the primary database. CLI options 
including `--db-host`, `--db-pass`, `--db-port`, `--db-type` and `--db-user` are dedicated for 
primary database connection only [link](../user-guide/2.1.cli-options.md).

To find out more about running SQL checks against different databases:

- [MySQL](./1.1.sql-check-mysql.md)
- [Postgres](./1.2.sql-check-postgres.md)
