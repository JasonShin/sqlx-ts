# File Base Configuration for connecting to Multiple DB

If you have a project that you need requires connections to multiple databases, you can support 
that by using file based configuration.

By default, configuration file is named `.sqlxrc.json`.

Example:

```json
{
  "default": {
    "DB_TYPE": "mysql",
    "DB_USER": "root",
    "DB_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
    "DB_PORT": 4321
  },
  "db2": {
    "DB_TYPE"
  }
}
```
