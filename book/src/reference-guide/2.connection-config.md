# File based config for multiple database connections

`sqlx-ts` supports three major ways to configure database connections and it picks the 
appropriate configuration in the priority of

1. CLI options
2. Environment variables
3. File based configuration

If you provide database host by a CLI option and an environment variable, CLI option will take 
the priority over the environment variable.

### 1. CLI options

You can only configure the primary database connection through CLI options. [Please check here for 
more details](../user-guide/2.1.cli-options.md).

### 2. Environment variables

You can only configure the primary database connection through environment variables. [Please 
check here for more details](./2.2.environment-variables.md)

### 3. File based config

If your project needs connections to multiple databases for SQL check, you have to use the file 
based config and specify connection details for those databases. [Please check here for more 
details](./2.1.configs-file-based.md)
