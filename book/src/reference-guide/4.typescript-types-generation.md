# TypeScript Types Generation

sqlx-ts provides the powerful Typescript type generation based on the raw SQLs that you write in your code.
The feature greatly enhances type safety of the raw SQL queries, ultimately replaces the need of ORM completely.

Without type generation, you would maintain type definition of each raw SQL manually, which is a brittle process and
becomes an extra management in large projects.

## Getting started

The simplest way to use type generation feature of sqlx-ts is by setting `-g` or `--generate-types` flag when running sqlx-ts CLI.


```bash
$ cargo run ./samples/type-generator-test --generate-types --config=<path to .sqlxrc.json>
```

[Please read more about .sqlxrc.json here](./2.1.configs-file-based.md)

## What's possible

sqlx-ts supports following type generations and other SQL syntax will be ignored from type generation

- SELECT statements
- INSERT statements
- UPDATE statements
- DELETE statements

Also type generation supports parameterised query as per the requirements of PREPARE statements of the databases
that sqlx-ts currently supports.
- [MySQL PREPARE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/prepare.html)
- [Postgres PREPARE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html)

| Database | Parameterised Query | Example                                               |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| MySQL    | ?                   | SELECT * FROM items WHERE points > ? AND points < ?   |
| Postgres | $1 $2 $3            | SELECT * FROM items WHERE points > $1 AND points < $2 |

in your codebase, if you have the following SQL query

```typescript
const simpleQuery = sql`
SELECT *
FROM items
WHERE points > ?
AND points < ?
`
```

by running sqlx-ts type generation against the query, it would generate

```typescript
export type ISimpleQueryParams = [number, number]

export interface ISimpleQueryResult {
    id: string
    points: number
}

export interface ISimpleQueryQuery{
    params: ISimpleQueryParams;
    result: ISimpleQueryResult;
}
```

sqlx-ts will pick up name of the variable and use it when generating the type definitions. You can override 
the type name by setting the `@name` annotation, you can read more in the section [below](#annotations).

## Annotations

Annotation is a way to configure custom settings for the type generator. Here are the supported annotations

| Annotation | Description                                                                                                                   |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| @name      | name to be used when generating types. It will override the default name (variable name) and it will be formatted in camelcase. |
| @db        | name of the database you'd like to use for the query. By default it will use `default`                                        |

```typescript
// example
const someQuery = sql`
-- @name: simpleQuery
-- @db: mysql
SELECT *
FROM items
WHERE points > ?;
`
```

Above example query will generate following types

```typescript
export type ISimpleQueryParams = [number]

export interface ISimpleQueryResult {
    id: string
    points: number
}

export interface ISimpleQueryQuery{
    params: ISimpleQueryParams;
    result: ISimpleQueryResult;
}
```

Note that types are generated with `SimpleQuery` namespace instead of the variable name `SomeQuery`. This is the result of setting `@name` annotation
in the query. Also, it will use `mysql` database connection that you configured in `.sqlxrc.json` as a result of setting `@db`.

### Overrides

sqlx-ts cannot generate typing for complex SQL syntax such as JSON functions. In this scenario, sqlx-ts will return `any` and you can use annotations
to override the result to a type that you anticipate.

```typescript
const someQuery = sql`
-- @result points -> number | null
SELECT
    id,
    JSON_EXTRACT(items.c, "$.points") as points
FROM items
`
```

would generate

```typescript
export type ISimpleQueryParams = []

export interface ISimpleQueryResult {
    id: string
    points: number
}

export interface ISimpleQueryQuery{
    params: ISimpleQueryParams;
    result: ISimpleQueryResult;
}
```

It's important that you give it an alias so sqlx-ts can match it with your custom annotation.


> Rust provides pattern matching that enforces you to handle all patterns of an enum.
> Based on this, we can exhaustively handle all SQL syntax and narrow down the patterns that sqlx-ts cannot handle.
> If you ever use following SQL syntax, it is encouraged to override the type using @result annotation.

## Configuration

## Q/A

##### Why doesn't SQLx support named parameterised queries? `e.g. SELECT * FROM items WHERE point = :point`

We believe that there is no official way in Typescript to ensure the value level type-safety yet and providing named parameter does not guarantee
the true type safetiness that we are trying to achieve. Furthermore, name parameter is not the syntax supported by native database drivers, but 
they are an additional syntax supported by popular ORM libraries such as Sequelize.

The closest type safety that exists in TypeScript world is by emulating Opaque type e.g. https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/blob/main/source/opaque.d.ts.
In the future, sqlx-ts will support Opaque type overrides natively to solve this matter.
