# TypeScript Types Generation

sqlx-ts provides the powerful Typescript type generation based on the raw SQLs that you write in your code.
The feature greatly enhances type safety of the raw SQL queries, ultimately replaces the need of ORM completely.

Without type generation, you would maintain type definition of each raw SQL manually, which is a brittle process and
becomes an extra management in large projects.

## Getting started

The simplest way to use type generation feature of sqlx-ts is by setting `-g` or `--generate-types` flag when running sqlx-ts CLI.


```bash
$ cargo run ./samples/type-generator-test --generate-types --config=<path to .sqlxrc.json>
```
