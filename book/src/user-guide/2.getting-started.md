# Getting Started

### Checking SQLs at compile time

This is the core feature that sqlx-ts offers. Being able to check your raw SQL queries at 
compile time is an extremely powerful feature, that only exists in languages like [Rust](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx), [Go](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) and 
Java [jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/).

It is simply done by running sqlx-ts binary, and it is the default operation if you pass 
If your project's primary database is MySQL, you must provide `--db-host`, `--db-port`, `--db-type`

```bash
$ sqlx-ts <path to project> --db-host=127.0.0.1 --db-port=54321 --db-type=postgres
```

By default, sql check operation ignores `node_modules`. Any extra ignore paths can be specified 
using `--ignore=<path>`.
